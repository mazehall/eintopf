Change Log
--------

v0.1.17
 - Manually run parsers to be consistent to all angular versions.

v0.1.16
 - Implement clear input mechanism, fixes [#53](https://github.com/adonespitogo/angular-base64-upload/issues/53)
 - Reimplemented `required` validation, overriding `ngModel.$isEmpty()` method :D

v0.1.15
 - Implement `on-after-validate` event
 - Removed `ngModel.$setViewValue(null)` that was used to activate `required` state of the input when it is multiple and model is predefined with value (e.g. `$scope.files = []`). It caused the [form to be initially dirty](https://github.com/adonespitogo/angular-base64-upload/issues/62). For multiple file selection with `required` validation, use `minnum="1"` instead of `required`, or just don't predefine the value of your model.

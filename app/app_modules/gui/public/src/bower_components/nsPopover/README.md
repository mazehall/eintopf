# nsPopover

``nsPopover`` is a simple component for angularjs applications that adds small overlays of content, like those on the
iPad, to any element for housing secondary information.. It has only angularjs as dependency.

### [Example] (http://nohros.com/nsPopover)

## Getting Involved
We use the Collective Code Construction Contract (http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:22).
collaboration model.

## Install

You can download all necessary nsPopover files manually or install it with bower:

```bash
bower install nsPopover
npm install
grunt compile
```

## Usage

You need only to include the ``nsPopover.js`` (as minimal setup) to your project and then you can
start using the ``nsPopover`` directives.

### Directive

```javascript
angular
  .module('nsPopoverExample', [
   'nsPopover'
  ])

  .controller('MainCtrl', function($scope) {
    $scope.items = [{
      name: "Action"
    }, {
      name: "Another action"
    }, {
      name: "Something else here"
    }];
  });
```

``` html
<script type="text/ng-template" id="popover">
  <ul>
    <li ng-repeat="item in items"><a>{{item.name}}</a></li>
  </ul>
</script>

<button ns-popover
  ns-popover-template="popover"
  ns-popover-trigger="click"
  ns-popover-placement="bottom">
    Popover
</button>
```

### Attributes

``nsPopover`` defines a simple set of attributes that can be used to customize the popover behavior.

### `ns-popover {Boolean}`

The popover will show by default but ff you set `ns-popover` attribute equal to
a scope variable whose value is false, the popover will not be displayed. IE:

```
// In controller:
$scope.displayPopover = false;

// In HTML:
<div ns-popover="displayPopover"></div>
```

### ``ns-popover-template {String}``

The id of the template that contains the popover content. The content will be loaded through the
angular ``$http`` service and cached (content will not be loaded if it is already in ``$templateCache``). It
can be loaded through ``path`` to external html template or ``<script>`` tag with ``text\ng-template``.

```javascript
<script type="text/ng-template" id="templateId">
  <h1>Template heading</h1>
  <p>Some content</p>
</script>
```

Also it is possible to use simple strings as template together with ``ns-popover-plain`` option.

### ``ns-popover-plain {Boolean}``

A flag that indicates if the ``ns-popover-template`` is a plain string or not, default: ``false``.

### ``ns-popover-trigger {String}``

The ``ns-popover-trigger`` specify how the popover is triggered. This can be any event that the associated
DOM element can trigger, default: ``click``.

### ``ns-popover-timeout {Number}``

The ``ns-popover-timeout`` specify the time to wait before closing the popover and after the mouseout event is
triggered by the popover, default 1.5 seconds, use -1 to disable to timeout.

### ``ns-popover-placement {String}``

Specifies how to position the popover relative to the triggering element. The placement attribute has the given
syntax: [position]|[alignment]. The [position] parameter specifies the position (top/right/bottom/left) of
the popover, and the alignment defines the alignment of the popover (left/center/right). The list below shows
the possible combinations of [position] and [alignment].

Position | Alignment | Description
-------- |---------- | -----------
top | center | The popover will be positioned above the triggering element and its horizontal center will be aligned with the horizontal center of the triggering element.
top | left | The popover will be positioned above the triggering element and its left side will be aligned with the left side of the triggering element.
top | right | The popover will be positioned above the triggering element and its right side will be aligned with the right side of the triggering element.
bottom | center | The popover will be positioned on the below the triggering element and its horizontal center will be aligned with the horizontal center of the triggering element.
bottom | left | The popover will be positioned below the triggering element and its left side will be aligned with the left side of the triggering element.
bottom | right | The popover will be positioned below the triggering element and its right side will be aligned with the right side of the triggering element.
left | center | The popover will be positioned on the left side of the triggering element and its vertical center will be aligned with vertical center of the triggering element.
left | top | The popover will be positioned on the left side of the triggering element and its top will be aligned with the top of the triggering element.
left | bottom | The popover will be positioned on the left side of the triggering element and its bottom will be aligned with the bottom of the triggering element.
right | center | The popover will be positioned on the right side of the triggering element and its vertical center will be aligned with vertical center of the triggering element.
right | top | The popover will be positioned on the right side of the triggering element and its top will be aligned with the top of the triggering element.
right | bottom | The popover will be positioned on the right side of the triggering element and its bottom will be aligned with the bottom of the triggering element.

### ``ns-popover-hide-on-click {Boolean}``

The ``ns-popover-hide-on-click`` specify whether to close the popover when clicking on it, default: ``true``. This
allows for element-targeted closing of the popover (e.g via a close button within the popover element).

### ``ns-popover-mouse-relative {{String}}``

Locks the position relative to the mouse. The following are possible values:
 * x - Constraints the x axis to follow the mouse.
 * y - Constraints the y axis to follow the mouse.
 * xy - Constraints both the x and y axis to follow the mouse.

### ``ns-popover-group {String}``

The ``ns-popover-group`` specifies the group of popovers which should be closed when this instance is shown. This allows
the construction of popovers that acts like a modal dialog.

### Programmatic Hiding of the Popover

Register the ``hidePopover()`` function against a ``ng-click`` directive to hide the popover when a specific element is clicked (e.g. a close button):

```html
<button ng-click="hidePopover()">Close</button>
```

This button lives within the popover template.

### Themes

You can customize the ``nsPopover`` through themes. You can use the ``nsPopover`` to create your own theme, like so.

```scss
.ns-popover-custom-theme {
  ul, .list {
  }

  li, .list-item {
    list-style-type: none;

    a {
      &:hover {
      }
    }
  }
}
```

and them specify this theme on the HTML

```html
  <button ns-popover
    ns-popover-template="popover"
    ns-popover-theme="ns-popover-custom-theme">
      Popover
  </button>
```
